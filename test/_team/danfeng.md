Dan Feng is a PhD student in the Computer Science program at Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science, advised by Professor Stacy Marsella. She is also a member of the CESAR (Cognitive Embodied Social Agents Research Laboratory). Dan, a native of China, received her bachelor’s degree in electronics science and technology, and her master’s degree in optical engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology. She is broadly interested in crowd-powered interactive narrative, machine learning, and virtual reality. Dan’s current research primarily focuses on generating interactive narrative based on crowdsourcing, and simulating social interactions in an interactive virtual environment.

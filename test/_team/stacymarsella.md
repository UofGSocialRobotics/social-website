Stacy Marsella is a Director of the <a href="http://cscan.gla.ac.uk/">Center for Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience at University of Glasgow.</a>

Prior to joining Glasgow, he was a Professor in the College of Computer and Information Science with a joint appointment in Psychology,  a research professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California, and a research director at the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). Before joining ICT, he was at USC’s Information Sciences Institute (1996-2009) and Bell Labs (1995-1996).

Professor Marsella’s multidisciplinary research is grounded in the computational modeling of human cognition, emotion and social behavior as well as the evaluation of those models. Beyond its relevance to understanding human behavior, the work has seen numerous applications, including health interventions, social skills training and planning operations. His more applied work includes frameworks for large-scale social simulations of towns and a range of techniques and tools for creating virtual humans, facsimiles of people that can engage people in face-to-face interactions.

Professor Marsella’s leadership positions in computer science include serving as a general chair of AAMAS (Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems) and chair of IVA (Intelligent Virtual Agents). In 2010, he received an ACM SIIGART career award for his contributions to agent research. He is an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, currently is a board member of the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, and is on the steering committee for IVA. He is a fellow of the Society of Experimental Social Psychologists, a member of AAAI and a member of the International Society for Research on Emotions.
